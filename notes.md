# Web Programming Notes
Git commands I've Learned and how I currently understand them
```
git status       //checks if my repsoitory is current on my device and online
git add          //Adds any new directories to the repository?
git commit       //Commits my changes to the repository to check to see if there are any conflicts
git push         //actually makes the changes to the repository
git pull         //gets any changes that were made somewhere else onto the device
```
