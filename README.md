## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**  

### **Frontend**  
- **HTML**:  
   - Four pages: Home (index), Art Editor, About, and Gallery.  
   - Links between pages and to this repository.  
   - Display usernames, prompts, and an interactive drawing grid (image placeholder for now).  
- **CSS**:  
   - Responsive layout using Bootstrap and custom grids.  
   - Consistent header, footer, color scheme, and fonts.  
   - Organized gallery using CSS grid.  
- **JavaScript**:  
   - **Application Logic**: Canvas-based pixel-by-pixel art creation.  
   - **Local Storage**: Save and display your artwork locally in the gallery page.  
   - **Dynamic WebSocket Simulation**: Displays placeholder "user colors" in real time.  
   - **Login Logic**: Navigate to the art creation page upon entering credentials.

### **Backend**  
- **Node.js / Express**:  
   - API endpoints for functionality.  
   - Static middleware to serve the frontend.  
   - Integrated calls to a third-party API for suggested color palettes.  
- **MongoDB Atlas**:  
   - Stores user credentials and artwork.  
   - API endpoints handle data retrieval and storage.  
- **WebSocket**:  
   - Enables real-time chat and live updates on the art page.
